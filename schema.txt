Doctor -> Appointment -> Treatment: Can view treatment for any patient that had an appointment with the doctor
Can view patient's profile like age, gender, medical history, blood group, etc.

Patient -> search -> doctor 
View doctor's profile - specialization, experience ( in years ), qualification
Patient -> Book appointment
Enter doctor name or specialization

# Relations:
Doctor -> Availability ( one to many )
A doctor can have many availabilities on various days.
Each availability belongs to a single doctor.

Doctor -> Appointment and Patient -> Appointment ( one to many )
A doctor and patient can have multiple appointments.
But each appointment can have a doctor and a patient.

Appointment -> Treatment ( one to one )
Each appointment can have one treatment
Each treatment belongs to a single appointment
